## Synopsis

This project is an implementation of an OpenJPA plugin for distributed caching
with a Redis backend. I've implemented both a DataCache and a QueryCache
plugin.

Keep in mind that using these plugins means that the underlying database must
only be written through a data model that uses this cache; otherwise you must
flush the Redis cache if you write the database independently.

## Code Example

TBD

## Installation

I haven't deployed to Maven yet due to lack of tests, but you may clone the
github repository and then run `mvn install` from the root directory.

## API Reference

Once you've run `mvn install` above, you may include the plugin in your persistence.xml as follows:
```xml
<persistence>
	<persistence-unit name="persistence-unit-name" transaction-type="JTA">
		<properties>
			<property name="openjpa.DataCache" value="com.github.jzila.cache.RedisDataCache"/>
			<property name="openjpa.QueryCache" value="com.github.jzila.cache.RedisQueryCache"/>
			<property name="openjpa.RemoteCommitProvider" value="sjvm"/>
		</properties>
	</persistence-unit>
</persistence>
```

You must also create a file named `openjpa_redis.xml` in your classpath. If you
do not do this, the defaults will apply (`localhost:6379` as the only server, and
an empty prefix). This file should appear as follows (placeholders for
localhost):

```xml
<redis>
	<!-- The list of servers that will be used for the distributed cache. Uses
		ShardedJedis to perform the consistent hashing -->
    <servers>
        <server>
            <host>localhost</host>
            <port>6379</port>
        </server>
    </servers>
	<!-- The prefix that will be used to preface the keys in your Redis database -->
    <prefix>foo</prefix>
</redis>
```

If you use this plugin with a Tomcat or TomEE server, you _must_ include all the dependencies
in your Tomcat's `/lib` folder. This is because Tomcat initializes OpenJPA independently of
each webapp, and so the jars included in the web app won't be visible to the OpenJPA classes.
